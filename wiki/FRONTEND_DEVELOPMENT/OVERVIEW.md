# Frontend Development Guidelines

This document describes various guidelines to ensure consistency and quality across the Primedevs frontend team.

## Browser Support

Primedevs supports the following web browsers:

- Mozilla Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Chromium
- Apple Safari
- Microsoft Edge

## Principles

These principles ensure that your frontend contribution starts off in the right direction.

```
### Discuss architecture before implementation

Discuss your architecture design in an issue before writing code. This helps decrease the review time and also provides good practice for writing and thinking about system design.

### Be consistent

There are multiple ways of writing code to accomplish the same results. We should be as consistent as possible in how we write code across our codebases. This makes it easier for us to maintain our code across Primedevs.

### Improve code iteratively

Whenever you see existing code that does not follow our current style guide, update it proactively. You donâ€™t need to fix everything, but each merge request should iteratively improve our codebase, and reduce technical debt where possible.
```
