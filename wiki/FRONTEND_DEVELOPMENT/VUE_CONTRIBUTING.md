# Vue.js Contributing Guide

Hi! We are really excited that you are interested in contributing to Primedevs Vue.js projects.
Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
- [Development Setup](#development-setup)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.

- Work in the `src` folder and **DO NOT** checking `dist` in the commits.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

- Make sure `npm test` passes. (see [development setup](#development-setup))

- If adding a new feature:
  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 8+**

After cloning the repo, run:

``` bash
$ npm install # install the dependencies of the project
```

### Committing Changes

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](./COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) so that changelogs can be automatically generated. Commit messages will be automatically validated upon commit. If you are not familiar with the commit message convention, you can use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit`, which provides an interactive CLI for generating proper commit messages.

### Commonly used NPM scripts

``` bash
# watch and auto re-build dist/vue.js
$ npm run dev

# watch and auto re-run unit tests in Chrome
$ npm run dev:test

# build all dist files, including npm packages
$ npm run build

# run the full test suite, including linting/type checking
$ npm test
```

There are some other scripts available in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.

The default test script will do the following: lint with ESLint -> type check with Flow -> unit tests with coverage -> e2e tests. **Please make sure to have this pass successfully before submitting a PR.** Although the same tests will be run against your PR on the CI server, it is better to have it working locally.

## Project Structure

- **`dist`**: contains built files for distribution. Note this directory is only updated when a release happens; they do not reflect the latest changes in development branches.

  See [dist/README.md](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/dist/README.md) for more details on dist files.

- **`src`**: contains the source code. The codebase is written in ES2015 with [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type annotations.
